# Guidelines for Prospective Students

:::tip **Important Notice (Please Read First)**

AINTLab does **not** offer research assistantships (RA) or fully funded positions.
Emails requesting scholarships or funding support will **not receive a reply**, **unless explicitly stated in a separate official announcement**.
Prospective students are expected to be **self-funded or supported by external scholarships**.
:::

These guidelines are intended for **self-funded prospective applicants** (PhD, MSc, or Internship) who wish to contact the Director of AINTLab. Due to the high volume of inquiries, **only well-prepared, relevant, and personalized emails are considered**. Generic emails and funding requests are routinely ignored.

## Purpose of Your Email
Your email should have a **clear academic purpose**, such as:
- Expressing interest in joining AINTLab (PhD, MSc, or Internship)
- Asking about research alignment or supervision availability
- Seeking guidance on the formal application process

Emails sent “just to ask” or without a clear objective are unlikely to receive a response.

---

## General Writing Guidelines

- Use a **professional, academic–conversational tone**
- Keep the email **concise and focused** (ideally 2–4 short paragraphs)
- Clearly state **who you are**, **why AINTLab**, and **what you are asking**
- Demonstrate that you have **read about AINTLab’s research**
- Mention your **funding status briefly** (self-funded or external scholarship), without requesting funding

---

## Do’s and Don’ts

### ✅ Do
- Address the director properly (e.g., *Dear Professor [Name]*)
- Personalize the email with **specific research interests**
- Briefly highlight **relevant background or experience**
- Attach your **CV** (and transcript if relevant)
- Ask **one or two clear, reasonable questions**

### ❌ Don’t
- Send generic or mass emails
- Ask for scholarships, funding, RA positions, or fee waivers
- Copy-paste the same email to multiple labs
- Write long personal stories or unrelated details
- Ask questions already answered on the website

---

## Subject Line Suggestions

Use a **clear and specific subject line**:

- *Prospective PhD Applicant – AI/Data Science Research*
- *MSc Applicant Interested in AINTLab Research*
- *Undergraduate Research Internship Inquiry*
- *Interest in AI Research at AINTLab*

Avoid vague subjects like *“Inquiry”* or *“Hello Professor”*.
